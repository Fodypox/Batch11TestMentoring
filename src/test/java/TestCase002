TC Title: Verify Drag and Drop Functionality on DemoQA
TC Description:
This test case verifies the drag-and-drop functionality on the "https://demoqa.com/droppable" page. It specifically tests dragging the "Drag me" button and dropping it onto the "Drop here" box, then verifies that the text within the "Drop here" box changes to "Dropped!".

TC Steps with Actions Class:
1-Initialize WebDriver: Open the browser and navigate to "https://demoqa.com/droppable".
2-Locate Draggable Element: Use WebDriver to find the element with the "Drag me" button.
3-Locate Drop Target: Find the element representing the "Drop here" box.
4-Perform Drag and Drop: Instantiate the Actions class and use its clickAndHold(draggableElement) method followed by moveToElement(dropTarget) and then release() to perform the drag and drop action.
5-Verify Text Change: After the drop action, verify that the text inside the "Drop here" box has changed to "Dropped!".

Expected Result:
After performing the drag and drop action, the "Drag me" button should visually move to the "Drop here" box.
The text within the "Drop here" box should change from "Drop here" to "Dropped!" confirming that the drop action was recognized by the application.
