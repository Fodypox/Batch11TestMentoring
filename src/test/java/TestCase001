TC Title: Verify Right-Click Context Menu and Navigation to Elemental Selenium
TC Description:
This test case aims to verify that a right-click on a designated area opens a context menu with the correct alert message "You selected a context menu". It also tests the functionality of navigating to the "Elemental Selenium" page and verifying the header text.

TC Steps with Actions Class:
1-Initialize WebDriver: Launch the browser and navigate to "https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/context_menu".
2-Locate the Right-Click Area: Use WebDriver to find the element that represents the area where the right-click action needs to be performed.
3-Perform Right-Click: Instantiate the Actions class and use its contextClick(element) method to perform a right-click on the located element.
4-Handle Alert: Wait for the alert to appear, verify that the alert text is "You selected a context menu", and then accept the alert to close it.
5-Navigate to Elemental Selenium: Find the "Elemental Selenium" link using WebDriver and click on it using the Actions class if necessary, or directly with the WebElement click method.
6-Verify Page Header: After the navigation, ensure the presence of an <h1> tag containing the text "Elemental Selenium".

Expected Result:
The context menu should be triggered with a right-click on the specified area, and an alert with the message "You selected a context menu" should appear.
Upon confirming the alert, it should close, allowing further actions.
After clicking the "Elemental Selenium" link, the browser should successfully navigate to the Elemental Selenium page, where the page header should read "Elemental Selenium".
